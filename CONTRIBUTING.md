Contributing
==============

If you find an issue, a pull request is always better than a bug report. Please fork and submit your code fixes.

If you want to build some new features, we have a [roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) of features we want. You can add features you want there, or just code the feature and send a pull request.
